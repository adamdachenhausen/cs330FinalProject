% The first line tells latex you want for a default font size and that
% you want to create an ``article''
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
% extra packages to bring in
\usepackage{latexsym}

\usepackage{epsfig}        % wrapper for graphicx package
\usepackage{times}
\usepackage{url}
\usepackage{hyperref}
% set some margins, these can be defined as in, cm, pt

\setlength{\textheight}{9in}
\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{0in}
\setlength{\evensidemargin}{0in}
\setlength{\textwidth}{6.5in}

% a few macros that might be useful -- any time we type \eg it expands
% to the italicized version defined here

\newcommand{\ie}{{\it i}.{\it e}.$\:$}

%% to remove page numbers, uncomment this:
%% \pagestyle{empty}

%% Define single-space command
\newcommand{\singlespace}{
  \protect\renewcommand\baselinestretch{1.0}
  \protect\normalsize
}
% use this instead if you want to disable it completely:
%%\newcommand{\singlespace}{}

%% Define double-space command (really more like 1.5 spacing)
%% This is essential for rough drafts, and not a bad idea even for
%%  final submissions
\newcommand{\doublespace}{
  \protect\renewcommand\baselinestretch{1.5}

\section{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

The goal of this project was to create a computer memory latency simulator. 
For its ease of use, Java was chosen to program this project in. This 
simulator is designed to simulate data transfer from one system component 
to another. For example, from the hard drive disk, to the main memory. 

In Section~\ref{sec:memlate} we discuss abstractly how the memory latency 
simulator works. Section ~\ref{sec:build} we describe how to build and run the 
simulator. In section ~\ref{sec:expstats} we explain all the types of 
information collected from the simulator. Then, in ~\ref{sec:data} we 
present the actual data collected from the simulator, as well as actual 
real world data. Section ~\ref{sec:disc} goes on to explain any discrepencies 
found between our data and the real world collected data. Finally, in
~\ref{sec:conclusions} we summarize our results, as well as report what
we have learned, and suggest how this simulator could be better
improved or used. 

\section{Simulating memory latency}
\label{sec:memlate}

Insert detailed description of the code here. 
Also describe components and terms as you go. 

\section{Building and Running the Simulator}
\label{sec:build}

\subsection{Java}
The simulator is written in Java, and therefore, you will need to have
Java installed to run it. See \url{https://www.java.com/en/download/}
 for more.

\subsection{Aquiring Source Code}
To download the simulator code, go to \url{osfinal.dachenhausen.org} 
or
\url{https://github.com/adamdachenhausen/cs330FinalProject} 
and clone the repository. See \url{https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository}
for more.

\subsection{Compiling}
\begin{itemize}

\item \section*{Command Line}
  The source code includes two ways to compile the simulator.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \section*{Make}
    The simulator source code includes a Makefile, so if Make
    is installed, the command \begin{verbatim} make \end{verbatim}
    will compile the simulator.
    
  \item
    \section*{Default}
    In the absence of Make, the default way to compile the simulator
    is to run
\begin{verbatim}
    javac *.java
\end{verbatim}
which will compile all of the Java files so they could be run.
    
  \end{itemize}
  
\item \section*{Using an IDE}
  Given the multitude of IDEs that are available, please see your
  specific IDE's manual for how to compile and run the simulator.
  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Licensing}
Before running the simulator, we would like to remind you that this
project is protected under the MIT License, so proceed at your own risk.

\subsection{Running the Simulator}
\begin{itemize}
\item Command Line
  Either way that the simulator was compiled, the command
\begin{verbatim}
  java memSim
\end{verbatim}
  will start the simulator
\item IDE
  Given the multitude of IDEs that are available, please see your
  specific IDE's manual for how to compile and run the simulator.
\end{itemize}

\section{Explanation of Statistics Gathered}
\label{sec:expstats}

Explain every statistic. 
Also describe components and terms as you go. 

\section{Data Gathered}
\label{sec:data}

Insert all the data gathered by the simulator and from sources here.
Explain any terms as needed (only if not already). 

\section{Disc}
\label{sec:disc}

Explain any discrepencies found here.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Summary, conclusions, discussion of the results, and ideas for future
work should be here.

Again, remember that writing is hard and writing well is very hard.  It
requires a long cycle of writing, reading, editing, rearranging,
rewriting, and so on.  If you are working in a group, have all group
members read and edit each others' sections.  Scientific writing
should be clear and concise.  If find a paragraph that says what can
be said in a sentence, cut it down to one sentence!

% it's nice to acknowledge any person or organization that helped out
% along the way.  The * after \section means this will not be assigned
% a section number
\section*{Acknowledgments}

The authors would like to thank all of our system administrators, past
and present, for installing the tools we needed on our systems and for
keeping those systems working smoothly while we completed this
project.

% Finally, the citations.  These lines tell latex what style to use
% (abbrv means to use first and middle initials instead of full names,
% among other things), and that your bibtex file is called
% references.bib
%
% bibtex alone should be enough to make anyone abandon any wysiwyg
% word processor and use latex for everything!
% 
% we'll also turn off double spacing for the citations
\singlespace
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{references}

% tell latex we're done.  Anything beyond this line will be ignored.
